# 🧪 Diabetic Classification using Machine Learning

This project presents a supervised learning pipeline for **diabetes classification** using machine learning models, implemented in the notebook `DiabeticClassification.ipynb`.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Goal**: Predict whether a patient is diabetic based on health indicators.
- 📊 **Dataset**: Commonly based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (or equivalent).
- 🤖 **Techniques Used**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature selection
  - Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
  - Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)
